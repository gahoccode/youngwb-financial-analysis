# Asset Composition, Liabilities and Equity Structure

REE's balance sheet discloses significant growth in total assets, which reached approximately 36.36 trillion VND in 2024, up from 34.91 trillion VND in 2023. The asset composition is heavily weighted towards long-term assets, indicating a strong investment stance, particularly in fixed assets (approximately 25.08 trillion VND). However, the liability structure also reflects high levels of current liabilities (approximately 13.91 trillion VND), raising concerns about short-term obligations relative to current assets (approximately 11.29 trillion VND in 2024). 

The owner's equity has increased to approximately 22.45 trillion VND, showing a positive trend in capital reserves. This balances the liability structure favorably, but maintaining a levered position suggests a careful approach to capital structure management is needed.

# Profitability Analysis

## Margins
- **Gross Profit Margin (GPM)**: 37% (2023) to 41% (2024) indicates improving production efficiency.
- **Operating Profit Margin (OPM)**: Improvement observed, moving from 36% (2023) to 38% (2024).
- **Net Profit Margin (NPM)** improved slightly from 26% to 27% in the same period, reflecting the firm’s ability to convert revenue into actual profit efficiently.

## Return Metrics
REE's returns are showing positive trends:
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: Increased from 6% to 7% indicating improved asset utilization.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Rose from 10% to 11%, showing enhanced value generation for shareholders.
- **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**: Positive growth suggests efficient use of capital to generate returns.

# Cash Flow Quality and Trends

Net cash inflows from operating activities improved significantly from approximately 2.81 trillion VND in 2023 to 3.78 trillion VND in 2024, signaling robust operational cash generation. However, the investing cash flows show significant outflows related to fixed asset purchases, indicating REE's commitment to long-term asset accumulation.

# Liquidity and Solvency Ratios

Key ratios indicate:
- **Current Ratio**: Stands at 0.81 (2024), revealing potential liquidity challenges.
- **Quick Ratio**: Lower than 1, reflecting less ability to cover current liabilities with liquid assets.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** of about 0.62 suggests moderate leverage, aligning with industry norms.

# Working Capital Management

The year-over-year assessment indicates increased inventory levels, from 3.55 trillion VND to 4.71 trillion VND, which impacts the working capital negatively. REE should consider inventory turnover efficiencies to free up capital.

# Year-over-Year Changes in Key Financial Items

Notable changes include growth in revenues from 8.57 trillion VND in 2023 to 8.39 trillion VND in 2024. Both the gross and net profit figures exhibit stable growth, emphasizing consistent performance.

# Integrated Analysis

The income statement and cash flow dynamics reflect operational strength, but the growing liabilities relative to sales growth should spur management to enhance inventory turnover and receivable collections.

# Dividend Sustainability Analysis

The dividend coverage ratio sits at approximately 11.49 in 2024, implying strong ability to sustain dividends given earnings coverage. REE’s profitability, coupled with a stable earnings outlook, supports ongoing dividend payments, aligning with investor expectations.

Overall, REE shows strong resilience; however, attention to liquidity management and operational efficiency in inventory and receivable management is vital for sustaining growth.
